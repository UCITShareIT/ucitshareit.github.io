##About this blog
The site was set up through GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Jekyll is a Ruby based static site generator that makes it easy to write posts and have them load automatically to the site.

Anyone posting to the Blog does not need to know or run Ruby! :clap:

In fact, you don't even have to pull down the code to add posts. :+1:

Navigate to the [_posts](_posts) folder and click "New File" to get started and follow the instructions below.


##Creating a new blog post
######(from the [Jekyll Website](http://jekyllrb.com/))

All new posts need to be saved to the ```_posts``` folder. 

When cfreating a post, you need to use the following format:
```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

Where ```YEAR``` is a four-digit number, ```MONTH``` and ```DAY``` are both two-digit numbers, and ```MARKUP``` is the file extension representing the format used in the file (md, html and such). For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:
```
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.textile
```

At the beginning of each post, you need to include [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).
Example:
```
---
layout: post
title: Blogging Like a Boss
---
```

After that, the rest is up to you!

You can use GitHub's help section on Basic syntax [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) if you need some extra guidance.
